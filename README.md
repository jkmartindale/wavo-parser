# wavo-parser
A PHP-based script that ran through the entirety of Wavo.me, extracted the download links of remix stem packages, and spit them up into a giant list. I created it as a practice assignment after finishing my PHP class' homework a little too early. I shared it with a few of my friends, and apparently they thought it was cool enough to spread it. Eventually it got posted on Reddit at least twice, and then eventually Wavo found it and shut it down. The script is completely untouched from the day it was shut down.
